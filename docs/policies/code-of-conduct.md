# Code of Conduct

For all of our communications, not just chat, we ask that you follow this Code of Conduct. (This can also be found in the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #code-of-conduct :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/967549690201653338){ target="_blank" } channel on Discord.)

1. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
2. No spam or self promotion (your YouTube channel videos, advertisements, etc.) without permission from a team member. This includes DMing fellow members. The only exception is sharing links to Other Discord Servers in the ‚Å†other-discord-servers channel. To post a an invite link, please send it to one of the admins for vetting and posting. This is a change from previous allowing anyone to post any server. Only because there are some off color and not safe for family ones out there.
3. No obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
4. If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, please let the Moderators know ASAP. We want this server to be a welcoming space.
5. No politics, religion, crude language or dirty jokes.
6. Please change your Server Profile name to the format of Callsign-Name-Extension. If you do not have an extension yet, Callsign-Name is fine. This way we know who we are talking to.
7. This service has the ability to dial by DMR ID. If you would like to use that, please obtain a DMR ID from [radioid.net :material-open-in-new:](https://radioid.net/){ target="_blank" }
8. Please post topics in appropriate channels.
9. Moderators/Admins have the discretion to enforce the rules of this server.
