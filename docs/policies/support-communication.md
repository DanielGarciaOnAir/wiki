# Support Communication Policy

All communication with our Technical Support team must be conducted **through your account** at [helpdesk.hamsoverip.com](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket).  This includes replying to responses, uploading documents, and submitting any additional information.

Please note the following:

- **Email notifications are one-way only**  
  The email you received is from a no-reply address and is sent solely to notify you of updates to your support ticket.

- **Do not reply to the email**  
  Any replies sent to the email address will not be received, seen, or acted upon by our support team.

- **To respond or upload documents**, you must log in to your Support Center account and interact directly within the ticket.

- **Failure to respond through the ticket system** will result in the ticket being closed due to non-response.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.
