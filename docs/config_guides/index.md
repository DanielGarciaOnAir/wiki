# Configuration Guides

Here, we've tried to provide you with a number of Guides to help you best use the Hams Over IP service.

## Categories

* [Endpoints](../endpoints/index.md) - _how to connect a telephony device to our network_
* [RF Links](../other/configure-rf-links.md) - _how to connect an Allstar node to our network_
* [BLF](../other/configure-blf.md) - _how to configure Busy Lamp Field (currently just for Cisco phones)_

---

This is by no means an exhaustive list... you can help us by [contributing](../wiki/contributing.md) a Guide where one doesn't already exist.
