## Troubleshooting

### The light for my HOIP extension is not green (its orange, amber, yellow) and I have not changed anything on my end. What has happened or what do I do?

!!! note ""
    This is becoming a common issue on the service we are finding. This could be a Carrier Grade NAT situation. We might have to make some adjustments on the peer for your extension.

    Some steps to take first (in order):

    * Reboot your modem
    * Reboot your router
    * Reboot your phone
    * Double check to make sure none of your configuration has changed (password, domain, etc.)
    * If you are using Hamshack Hotline, [please check here](./faq.md#i-had-to-reprovision-my-phone-with-hh-and-now-hoip-will-not-work-how-do-i-fix-this) to make sure the settings are correct.

    If these do not fix the issue, you will need to open a ticket to the helpdesk. We will need to make some adjustments. 

    In the ticket, please include the following information:

    * Your name, callsign
    * Your extension
    * Mention the fact that your light is orange
    * Include your IP Address
        * One thing to note here, if you have a Dyanmic DNS Service like DuckDNS or No-IP or similiar, this can be used as well, and is actually prefered. That way we don;t have to keep updating your IP address. Do a search for Dynamic DNS Services online.

    To get your IP address, please go to [https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/diy](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/diy) and copy and paste the IP address that is shown there into the ticket. 

    This will allow the admins to make the adjustments needed and then they will get back to you about the fix being implemented.

### I had to reprovision my phone (with HH) and now HOIP will not work. How do I fix this?

!!! note ""
    Hamshack Hotline provisions certain phones from their servers and take over line 1 of the phone. When a user needs to reprovision since HH does not care if other services could be running on the phone, there are alot of settings problems that are induced to the phone by them, which causes problems for end users.

    For those of you that have reprovisioned your phone due to Hamshack Hotline or a factory reset and then reprovisioning Hamshack Hotline to fix these issues and be able to use other services:

    * Goto your HOIP extension tab and change TCP to UDP.
    * In the `SYSTEM` tab, please fill in 
        * `PRIMARY DNS` with 8.8.8.8
        * `SECONDARY DNS` to 8.8.4.4
        * or you can use DNS servers of your choice (for example if you run a DNS source on your home network like Pi-Hole or if you don't want to use the Google servers above).  
    * Make sure you have your HOIP extension configured with the proper credentials.
    * Submit changes and reboot.

### My phone is provisioned but I don't hear any audio after the dial tone when I check my voicemail or make any calls

!!! note ""
    Check the audio settings of the phone. Make sure the volume is turned up and there are no loose connections. If the phone checks out physically, check to see if the phone is behind a firewall. If it is the following ports need to be opened outbound only. (Keep in mind this is NOT port forwarding, just simply allowing the phone to initiate a connection on these ports)

    * SIP Ports UDP - 5160
    * DNS Ports UDP - 53
    * NTP Ports UDP - 123
    * RTP Ports UDP - 10000 through 15000  NOTE: RTP port can vary on what is set for your device to use.

## Phones

### What phones work with HOIP?

!!! note ""
    The nice thing about the Hams Over IP service is we are a BOYD (Bring Your Own Device) service. So any phone that you can configure for SIP connections can be used on the service, on any peer. We have people that use Cisco, Grandstream, Polycomm, Yealink, Fanvil, Softphones and many other types of phones.

    As long as you can configure the phone to use SIP, you are good to go.

### How do I configure X phone to work with HOIP?

!!! note ""
    Take a look through the Configuration Guides in the Wiki and see if your phone has a configuration guide. If not, you can ask on any of our [chat services](./user/chat-services.md) to see if someone has configured it.

    If there is not a configuration guide, you are also welcome to contribute to the Wiki and add a guide for your phone. That would help out others. To see how to contribute, look at the [Contributing Guide](../wiki/overview.md).

### I had to reprovision my phone or factory reset my phone and I cannot find/lost my credientals. What do I do?

!!! note ""
    If you can't find your credentials, you can put a ticket into the [Helpdesk Ticketing](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/) system and request your credentials be resent to you.

### How do I access my Voicemail?

!!! note ""
    Dial `*97` from your phone or hit the voicemail button. This will drop you into your mailbox. If this is the first time accessing your mailbox, the system will walk you through setting up your outgoing voicemail messages and make you change your pin. Once you have all this setup, all you need to do is dial `*97` from your phone, or hit the voicemail button and it will just drop you into your box to let you retreive messages.

## PBXs

### What PBXs work with HOIP?

!!! note ""
    Good Question. As of right now, we know that FreePBX and 3CX both work with the service. Both can connect via SIP Trunks and FreePBX is able to use IAX. But otherwise, we don't really know of more. If you know of others that use SIP Trunks and can configure them, we would like to know more about it. In fact, if you can create a configuration guide, please submit it.

    If you want to use FreePBX or 3CX, please check out the configuration guides for each here in the Wiki.

### How do I configure my PBX to work with HOIP?

!!! note ""
    Good question! If it's one we have a guide for, check out the configuration guides for the PBXs. If it's one that we don't have a guide for, please write one up and submit it.

## Website/Ticket System

### I am a new user and just created an account in OS Ticket, but I am not able to log in

!!! note ""
    Chances are pretty good the verification email from the system was sent to your spam folder. There are some email providers that either block or mark the emails as spam. Check your spam folder. If it's not there, it might have been blocked. Reach out to an admin on Discord and see if they can activate your account. Once that is done, you should be able to log in and see your tickets.

### I put a ticket in to get a new extension, but I have not gotten my credentials email?

!!! note ""
    This could be a couple of things:

    * Remember we are all volunteers. We try to get to tickets as quick as we can, but we also have lives outside of this project. So it could take a day or two before we can get to the ticket
    * Possibly the same reason as above. Your email provider spam foldered it or blocked it. Again, reach out to an admin on Discord and they can DM you your credentials.
