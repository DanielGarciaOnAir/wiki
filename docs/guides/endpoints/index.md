# Endpoints

You can connect up to 10 hardphone or softphone endpoints to a PJSIP extension at the same time, or you can run your own PBX and set up an IAX2 trunk between yourself and Hams Over IP.  Whichever way you wish to do it, we have a number of Configuration Guides to help you.

## Guides

* [Hard Phone](./hardphones/index.md) _- physical desk phones or ATA devices_
* [Soft Phone](./softphones/index.md) _- software applications for desktop or mobile platforms_

This is by no means an exhaustive list... you can help us by [contributing](../../wiki/contributing.md) a Guide where one doesn't already exist.
