# Grandstream GXP21xx-series

The Grandstream GXP21xx series is a family of high-end IP phones designed for business users who need advanced features and handle high call volumes. While they share core functionalities like HD audio, a Linux-based OS, and Gigabit Ethernet ports with PoE, the main differences lie in the number of lines, display size and resolution, and programmable keys.

These instructions are based on the GXP2160, however the GXP21xx-series uses the same underlying firmware so the web interface should look the same, except for where the featureset differs.
