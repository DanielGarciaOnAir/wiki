**Don’t Have a DMR ID? No Problem!**

Even if there’s no DMR coverage in your area - or you never plan to use DMR - you can (and should) still get a DMR ID at [radioid.net](https://radioid.net).

We use **RadioID.net** as our phonebook source, which means:

- Your contact info stays up to date
- You can manage changes if you move or your license details change
- It keeps our system running smoothly and helps others find you more easily

Once your DMR ID is issued, return to HamsoverIP and complete your ticket request.
