    Go to the [Helpdesk](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/).

2. **Open a New Ticket**  

    In the top right corner, click the blue button labeled "**Open a New Ticket**".

3. **Select the correct Help Topic**  

    <div class="tohide">

    === "Americas (IARU Region 2)"
        From the "**Help Topic**" dropdown menu, change the selection from "**General Inquiry**" to "**NEW EXTENSION REQUEST – AMERICAS**".

    === "Europe (IARU Region 1)"

4. **Fill out the form**

    - Please complete **all required fields** (marked with a red asterisk).

    - If you have a DMR ID you can have it added in so it will allow us to display where you are located in the phonebook and allow DMRID Dialing.  
      If you do not have a DMR ID that is fine as it is not required to have an extension.
