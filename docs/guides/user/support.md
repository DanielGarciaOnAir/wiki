# Finding Help (Getting Support)

We are here to help and support you to get your devices working correctly on Hams Over IP.  However, we recognise that there may be times when things don't always go right... so reach out to us!

## Where to go

If you need help, here are some steps to take:

* Look through this Wiki first. A lot of common questions have already been answered here.
* In particular, check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting.md) **first** - many problems that people experience will be covered by it
* If you don't find an answer in these pages, put in a ticket in our [ticketing system :material-open-in-new:](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/osticket/).  This allows us to track issues, and also allows us to see what common issues are so that we can either put a fix in place, or generate a Wiki article to help others in the future.
* Once you have raised a ticket, someone may reach out for further information or to schedule time with you to connect on Discord to get more information or even walk you through your issue.
* You can ask for help in one of our chat servers. Please [Chat Services Guide](./chat-services.md) look here to see what we support and how they are connected: . Keep in mind though you will get alot of answers and it will not be a tracked issue.

The key point here is to make sure you raise that ticket, so that issues and problems can be tracked easier.

## When asking for help

Help us to help you.  If you are at the point of reaching out via Discord/Telegram/Matrix or putting in a ticket, there are some things that will be helpful to know:

* Your Phone Model
* Are you using your own PBX?
* Your ISP you are using
* What steps have you already taken to try to solve the problem (looked through the wiki, been through the Troubleshooter, rebooted, checked configurations, etc)?
* Do you have any other VOIP phone services on the phone (Ham Radio or otherwise)?
