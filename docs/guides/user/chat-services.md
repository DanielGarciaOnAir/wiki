# Our Chat Services Guide

Realtime communication is one of the keys off our organization. In addition to the phone service, we have setup a chat network that allows users to communication with use via chat and other means.

Currently, we use the following platforms:

* [Discord](#discord-server) _(primary)_
* [Telegram](#telegram-group)
* [Crosslink Lobby Chat](#crosslink-lobby-chat) _(if you don't have Discord or Telegram)_
* [Matrix](#matrix-room)

At this time, only the Telegram group is bridged to the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #lobby](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/966806535466524714) channel of our Discord server.  The Matrix channel is still standalone, but there's usually someone around to help.

!!! warning "**Please observe our [Code of Conduct](../../policies/code-of-conduct.md) at all times whilst using any of these services**"

<!--Keep in mind that all of these platforms are not setup as independent entities. These are all linked together as a way of extending the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) ethos. In this case it's more of a Choose Your Own Platform kind of thing.-->

## Discord Server

**Discord is our main/official method of non-VOIP phone communication.** It is here where you can find support and help when setting up your phone and such. It has most all of our main communications channels in it for finding help.

[:fontawesome-brands-discord: Join our Discord Server :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.gg/6VgdWw3vM4){ target="_blank" }

After joining, we ask that you do a couple of things:

* Make sure to read the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #code-of-conduct :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/967549690201653338){ target="_blank" } channel
* Please change your server nickname to be the format of CALLSIGN-Name-EXT. Your actual user name can be anything you want.
  * The nice thing about Discord is you have one overall username, but you can set your server nickname to be anything on any server. It can be different on every server.
  * To change your server nickname:
    * Right click on the Server Icon in the left side server list, the server name at the top, your name in the main message window and your user name in the user list on the right side of the screen.
    * Go to `Edit Server Profile`
    * Change the field that says `Server Nickname`
    * If it says you need to pay for Discord Nitro, you are doing it wrong. Server Nicknames are free to set.

## Telegram Group

We also have a Telegram Group that users can use if they choose to.

[:fontawesome-brands-telegram: Join our Telegram group :material-open-in-new:](https://t.me/hamsoverip){ target="_blank" }

This group is bridged into the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #crosslink-lobby :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/1401835917773242378){ target="_blank" } channel of our Discord server so that everyone in each group can participate in conversations or seek help.

## Crosslink Lobby Chat

We now have a brand-new [Crosslink Lobby Chat :material-open-in-new:](https://helpdesk.hamsoverip.com/crosslink/){ target="_blank" } which you can use if you don't use Discord.  Anything you type here will appear in the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #crosslink-lobby :material-open-in-new:](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/1401835917773242378){ target="_blank" } channel on our Discord server, and also in our [Telegram group](#telegram-group).

This channel is accessible to anyone who is in our Discord server, so please don't use it to share passwords or IP addresses.  If you require assistance from one of our amazing Support Team, put out a call in this chat then you can determine an alternative way to discuss your support issue.  Please be patient though!

## Matrix Room

We also have a public room on the matrix.org public instance.

[:simple-matrix: Join our Matrix room :material-open-in-new:](https://matrix.to/#/#hamsoverip:matrix.org){ target="_blank" }

This room is currently standalone and _not_ bridged to our Discord or Telegram rooms.

<!--This room is also bridged into our Discord server in the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: #lobby](https://discord.com/channels/966060559961296956/966806535466524714) channel.-->
